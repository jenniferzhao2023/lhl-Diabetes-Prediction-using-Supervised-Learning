# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.
### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes
### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked."

### Key findings:
After exploaring data by using PCA, Hierarchical Clusting, and K-Means for clustering. We can get findings as below:
    
1. PCA: the data dimention can be reduced to 4,The first principal component explains approximately 44.3% of the variance, followed by the second component with 26.4%, the third component with 12.3%,
        and the fourth component with 10.1%. These components capture the most significant patterns or trends in the data.
2. Hierarchical Clusting: the results of hierarchical clustering indicate that using 2 clusters is the best option and the single and average linkage methods achieved higher silhouette scores.
3. Kmean Clustering :the best-performing clustering result is obtained with 2 clusters, supports the effectiveness of a 2-cluster solution.
